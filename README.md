- `token_bot`, the token of the bot available on the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) section.

To customize the emojis go to the file `emojis.json`.
Emojis are already defined by default but you can modify them if you wish.

```js
{
    "music": ":musical_note:",
    "queue": ":bar_chart:",
    "error": ":x:",
    "success": ":white_check_mark:"
}
```

In the console, type `npm install` to install all dependencies.

To start the bot :
